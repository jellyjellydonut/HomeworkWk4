        The range of different hydroponics systems is fascinating. From simpler ones like Kratky, DWC, and wick, to the more complex NFT, flood & drain and drip, I'm looking forward to implementing a few of these in my final design. I enjoyed learning about closed loop systems and how we're trying to emulate one. 

        We've discussed a lot about the ethics and equity of our farming at every point: seed sourcing, production, distribution, materials, and pollution. I'm looking forward to calculating or considering these impacts with my own system and making it as harm-free as possible. I hope to be able to give my produce back to friends, family, and community fridges.

    <h1 class="headers">Technology</h1>
      <p class="blog">
        This has been a tough one! I had no coding experience coming into this and it's definitely creating a learning curve. I really enjoy being able to run code, see what it spits out, make changes, and watch how I get to my desired output! I've enjoyed using and learning about CSS for this reason. class, div, and inputting images have been some of the most interesting and helpful tags so far. I'm looking forward to learning how we're going to integrate technology with our farm systems.

    <p class="blog">
        Our first construction day was super cool. Alejandro is an excellent instructor, testing us to throughout to make sure we retained all of the information, such as what types of tools we were using (speed square, back saw, rip cut saw, etc.). He's teaching us what it's like to grow and maintain a community garden, which included reinforcing the garden beds made from pallets. Remember, measure twice, cut once!

    <h1 class="headers">Hands-On</h1>
    <p class="blog">
        The lab days have been very helpful for visualizing what my indoor farm will look like. That includes the types of plants I want to grow and the systems that will support them. Having begun a rough draft of the floor plan on Canva, I have a better idea of what I'm working with.
